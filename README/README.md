# ODSA-BoW
Repo for all activity related to the ODSA Bunch of Wires Specification

# Contribution Guidelines
If you'd like to contribute to ODSA-BoW and develop specifications, here's how you can.

## Madoko
We recommend that all contributors use [Madoko](http://madoko.net) - a live markdown editor - to write specs. There are several advantages that Madoko provides that we believe will make the contribution process easier:

* Madoko is a live markdown editor. All changes made are immediately visible on the generated document. 
* Madoko has integrated their software with a number of common services - including GitHub! More on how to open documents on Madoko directly from your fork of ODSA-BoW will be provided below
* Madoko automatically enumerates sections and subsections. If you're interested in presenting your specs through other mediums (PDF, etc.) it's come enumerated
* Madoko makes it easy for users to download those documents as PDFs, HTML, and even LaTeX.

## Forking the Repo
Forking a repository will create a copy of the main repo in your GitHub account. Then, you will be able to make all the changes you need to on your local copy before re-submitting through a pull request. 

Navigate to the [ODSA-BoW](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/ODSA-BoW) repository. Next to the "Watch" and "Star" Buttons will be a "Fork" button. Select it

## Creating and Saving a New File in Madoko
If you're editing and uploading a brand-new spec onto Madoko, you can start with a blank, pre-formatted Madoko document. Open the [live editor](https://www.madoko.net/editor.html). Edit the document as you see fit. When it's time to save, Find the folder icon in the top left corner and click the "Save To" option.

Madoko will present a variety of options from your local drive to cloud storage options like DropBox and, very conveniently, GitHub. Select GitHub. If you haven't already allowed Madoko access to your account, do so now. Then, find the forked version of the repo, and then where in the repo you'd like to save your file.

Madoko's integration with GitHub means that when you save the file, you're actually officially committing the file to GitHub. Write a short, but descriptive commit message and save the file.

If you find the forked repository on your GitHub account, it should register the commit you just made.
